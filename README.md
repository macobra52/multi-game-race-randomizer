Multi-Game Race Randomizer V0.1
by MaCobra52

As the title says, this is indeed a randomizer to generate a multi-game race allowing you to filter the games and type of goals you want to generate, whether they by short achievement-based objectives or longer full speedrun categories. The choice is up to you!

Note:
-Be sure Java is installed on your machine prior to running.

Instructions:
1. Double Click 'Multi-Game Race Randomizer.exe'
2. Select which games you would like to include as part of the randomization.
3. Select which types of goals you would like to include as part of the randomization.
4. By default, all goals generated will be for unique games. To override this check 'Allow duplicate games' (may be required depending on previous selections)
5. If you want the console to stay the same for all goals generated (all NES games, for example), check 'Same console'.
6. Select the race length (between 2 and 9 goals)
7. Click 'Generate!'

Your randomized multi-game race will appear, including the selected games, goals, descriptions, and the specific time in which the goal is considered completed.

Possible Errors:
You may see error messages appear while adjusting the randomizer options. These are checks to be sure that randomization is possible with the options you selected. For a description of the error and resolution you can click the message and a helpful dialog box will appear.

Features to come:
-More games and goals (of course)
-LiveSplit integration?
-Other features?

Please report any bugs you find and of course, enjoy!
